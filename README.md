Youtube data Harvesting using python, Mongo DB, Postgres with Streamlit
**About this project:**
Youtube-Data-Harvesting-And-Warehousing is a Data Harvesting and Warehousing project that intends to provide users with the ability to access and analyse data from numerous YouTube channels. SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit are used in the project to develop a user-friendly application that allows users to retrieve, save, and query YouTube channel and its video data. Here user only needs a channel ID of a particular channel with which user can retrive and save data for analysis. 
**Note:** User can get chennal_id from source_page of each channel
TOOLS AND LIBRARIES USED: this project requires the following components:

STREAMLIT: Streamlit library was used to create a user-friendly UI that enables users to interact with the programme and carry out data retrieval and analysis operations.
**Library: streamlit**

PYTHON: Python is the primary language employed in this project for the development of the complete application, including data retrieval, processing, analysis, and visualisation.
**Libaray:pandas**

GOOGLE API CLIENT: The googleapiclient library in Python facilitates the communication with different Google APIs. Its primary purpose in this project is to interact with YouTube's Data API v3, allowing the retrieval of essential information like channel details, video specifics, and comments. By utilizing googleapiclient, developers can easily access and manipulate YouTube's extensive data resources through code.
**Library: googleapiclient.discovery**

MONGODB: MongoDB is built on a scale-out architecture that has become popular with developers of all kinds for developing scalable applications with evolving data schemas. As a document database, MongoDB makes it easy for us to store structured or unstructured data. 
**Library: pymongo**

POSTGRESQL: PostgreSQL is an open-source and highly scalable database management system (DBMS) known for its reliability and extensive features. It provides a platform for storing and managing structured data, offering support for various data types and advanced SQL capabilities.
